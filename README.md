README

This code is an implementation of a decision tree regression model for predicting house prices based on certain features.

To run this code, you will need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

1. pandas
2. scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip, a package manager for Python:

Copy code:

pip install pandas scikit-learn

The dataset used in this code is the "Home Data for Machine Learning" dataset, which can be found at the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-data-for-ml-course/data

Once you have downloaded the dataset, make sure to update the file path in the code to match the location where you have saved the dataset.

The code consists of the following steps:

1. Load the dataset using pandas
2. Specify the list of features to be used for the model
3. Create an instance of the DecisionTreeRegressor model from scikit-learn
4. Fit the model using the features and target variable from the dataset
5. Make predictions using the model
You can check your progress and accuracy of the model at each step using the provided check functions from the learntools library.

Feel free to modify the list of features or hyperparameters of the model to improve its accuracy.

Enjoy!
